The speed of a node receiving a transactions in its txpool is important in many ways: for a DeFi service provider, it means a better user experience; for NFT traders, it means being able to sell and buy tokens quicker.

Would it be useful to have a tool to measure the txpool performance of a node?

EVM speed tester is the tool that does exactly that. It measures how fast a node can get a transaction in its txpool sent from a different node. It is installation free and easy to use.
